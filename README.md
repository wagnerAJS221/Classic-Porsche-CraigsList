# Classic-Porsche-CraigsList


##Classic Porsche selling app

- The Core plan is to build a UI that would have a Instagram / Facebook style feed where a user can view classic porsches that are for sale. 

- **what type of useability should my app have ?**
1. A home page with a Nav bar at the top. copy the insta/facebook type feed 
2. User can scroll through feed and ‘favourite’ images which will show in their favourites. 
3. User can view car profile and can see owners contact details as well as a comment section to check availability
4. User able to filter the feed via car type, price and 
5. User can hit ‘back to top’ button when the end of the feed is reached.
